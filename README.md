* [hmm](hmm) - Implementation of Hidden Markov Models
  * [hmm_guide.ipynb](hmm/hmm_guide.ipynb) is a guide for implementing the HMM algorithms (forward, backward and Viterbi)
  * [hmm.py](hmm/hmm.py) contains the implementations described in the guide
  * [test.py](hmm/test.py) contains an example of usage
  * [utils.py](hmm/utils.py) contains some useful functions

## Getting started

### Requirements
Implementations are based on [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) arrays.
```bash
pip install numpy
```
In order to play with the guides make sure to install [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook).
```bash
pip install notebook
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/katarinaelez/bioinformatics-algorithms

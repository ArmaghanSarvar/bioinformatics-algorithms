# hmm
Implementation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) algorithms in Python.
* [HMM_guide.ipynb](HMM_guide.ipynb) is a guide for implementing the HMM algorithms (forward, backward and Viterbi).
* [hmm.py](hmm.py) contains the implementations described in the guide.
* [test.py](test.py) contains an example of usage.
* [utils.py](utils.py) contains some useful functions.

## Getting started

### Requirements
Implementations are based on [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) arrays.
```bash
pip install numpy
```
In order to play with the guide make sure to install [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook).
```bash
pip install notebook
```
